# Variance-inflation-factor-VIF-
Variance inflation factor (VIF) A common function used for testing regression assumptions and specifically multicolinearity and unlike many statistical concepts,
The Variance Inflation Factor is a measure of colinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression.
It is calculated by taking the the ratio of the variance of all a given model's betas divide by the variance of a single beta if it were fit alone.
